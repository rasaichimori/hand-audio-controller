     *
     * When VST3PluginState is sent to the engine, the version is not relevant, so
     * it can be set as 0.
     *
     * During the engine → nexus plugin state sync process (that runs on a time
     * interval), we compare this version with the previous state version we
     * received from the engine. If the reported state version is not greater than
     * the previous state version, it means the engine plugin state hasn't been
     * updated yet and should be ignored. This prevents race conditions where we
     * might mistakenly sync the previous state back to nexus.
     *
     * Race condition example:
     *   1. Engine and nexus plugin states are both "A" (version = 1)
     *   2. Nexus plugin state changes to "B", triggering an engine plugin state
     *      update request (async)
     *   3. Engine -> Nexus plugin state sync process starts before plugin state
     *      update request completes
     *   4. Sync reads engine plugin state "A" (version = 1)
     *   5. Since version (1) is not greater than the locally stored version (1),
     *      we skip syncing "A" back to nexus, preserving the newer "B" state.
     *
