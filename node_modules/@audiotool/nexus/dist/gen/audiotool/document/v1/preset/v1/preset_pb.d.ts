 * A preset for a device in an audiotool project.
 *
 * Presets are used to save and load device settings in an audiotool project.
 * A preset is always "applied to" an existing entity of the same type as the "target"
 * entity. When applying a preset, the existing entity is updated with the values
 * from the "target" entity, and the "relatives" are created fresh into the project.
 *
 * The "target" entity is usually a "main device" entity, and relatives are entities
 * that reference the main entity, or are referenced by it, and come as part of the preset.
 *
 * For example, the target entity might be a "machiniste" entity, and relatives could be
 * "machinstePattern", "sample" and/or "groove" entities.
