 *
 *  The Helmholtz is a device that has up to 5 short delay lines
 *  that can be tuned to make certain frequencies resonate,
 *  resulting in something akin to a comb filter, i.e. a filter
 *  that filters out frequencies that are multiples of a certain frequency.
 *
 *  The filter frequencies can be set to specific notes such as C4, D3, etc.
 *
 *  Because it's implemented with delay lines, the Helmholtz sounds like
 *  it's "resonating" and highlighting certain frequencies and their overtones,
 *  and the resonance frequencies will sound after the incoming signal has become quiet.
