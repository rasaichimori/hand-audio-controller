 *  Datastructure holding how the values are split.
 *  The splitting works according to a triangle spanned by the following three corners:
 *  - A: coordinate (1, 0.5)
 *  - B: coordinate (0, 0)
 *  - C: coordinates (1, -0.5)
 *
 *  Given a `AudioSplitterCoordinates` point (x, y), the gain for outputs for A, B, and C depends on the distance
 *  from the Split point to their respective corners after the y value is clipped such that the
 *  point lies inside the triangle.
 *
 *  For example, point (1, 0) lies inside the triangle, so the distances are calculated from the
 *  point directly; point (0.5, 0.5) however lies outside triangle, so the y value is clipped to move the
 *  point to the edge of the triangle, in this case (0.5, 0.75), before the distances are calculated.
 *
 *  The default values are chosen such that the distance to all three corners is equal.
 *
 *  Note: The Barycentric coordinate system was considered, but not used to the following reasons:
 *  - non-unique coordinates for a given point
 *  - undefined coordinate (0, 0, 0)
 *  - the old documents work using the system above, hence is the behavior expected by users
