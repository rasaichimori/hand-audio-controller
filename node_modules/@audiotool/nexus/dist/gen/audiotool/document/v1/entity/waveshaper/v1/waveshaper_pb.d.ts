/**
 * The waveshaper is a distortion effect that allows to remap the amplitude of
 * the incoming signal according to a curve defined by a series of anchors.
 *
 * The mix factor can be modulated by an envelope that's triggered by the peak
 * of the main incoming signal or a side-chain signal.
 *
 * The curve of the waveshaper is defined by a series of anchors that mark points
 * on the plane spanned by (0, 0) and (1, 1). To draw the curve, sort
 * all anchors by x-coordinate and then connect them with lines such that
 * line between p1 and p2 are sloped with the slope parameter of anchor p2.
 *
 * There are two implicit anchors:
 * - one at (0, 0) where the curve starts
 * - one at (1, y) where the curve ends, sloped with "final_slope" field.
 *   where y is the "final_y" field.
 *
 * This is to make sure the curve always starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, 1),
 * and that the curve can be sloped even if no anchor is present.
