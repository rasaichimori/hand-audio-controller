/**
 * A few constants to work with ticks.
 *
 *
 * A "tick" is the finest resolution something can be scheduled in on the timeline.
 * Ticks are independent of tempo.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * In a 4/4 bar, there are 4 beats, so one bar is 4 * {@link Beat} = 15360 ticks = {@link SemiBreve}.
 *
 * For conversion from/to seconds see:
 * * {@link secondsToTicks}
 * * {@link ticksToSeconds}
