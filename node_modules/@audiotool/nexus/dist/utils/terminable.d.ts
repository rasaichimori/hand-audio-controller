/**
 * The `Terminable` interface provides a mechanism for lifecycle management
 * of certain operations or entities.
 * It offers a means to terminate or invalidate an action, essentially acting as a cleanup or undo mechanism.
 *
 * This interface is especially useful in scenarios where dynamic adjustments,
 * resource releases, or reversions of temporary settings are needed.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const action: Terminable = subscribeToAProgress()
 * // ... some code ...
 * action.terminate() // This will undo or clean up the action.
 * ```
 *
 * Implementing classes should ensure that the `terminate` method safely
 * handles the necessary cleanup or invalidation actions required for
 * the context in which it's used.
